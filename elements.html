          <h2>Search Engines</h2>
          <p>
            Engineered a search engine in C++ that processes text data to build
            an inverted index, enabling efficient query handling. Implemented
            text cleaning and tokenization to remove punctuation and normalize
            words. <br /><br />
            The engine supports complex search queries using set operations like
            union, intersection, and difference, to return relevant search
            results. Developed the ability to handle large datasets with
            optimized data structures such as maps and sets, showcasing
            proficiency in file I/O, string manipulation, and algorithmic design
            for search functionality.

          <h2>UIC CS Student App</h2>
          <p>
            Developed a python based program that serves the specific needs of
            UIC Computer Science students, aiding in their academic journey and
            fostering a sense of community. <br /><br />
            Included information such as UIC CS degree audits and plans, ways to
            get around campus and discover new places, as well as CS Based clubs
            for students to discover.
          </p>
          <h2>All About Allstate</h2>
          <p>
            Pioneered an interactive educational game on insurance, integrating
            Python with HTML5/JavaScript to create immersive and interactive
            learning experiences. <br /><br />
            Optimized the app using agile methodologies, enhancing user
            experience and continuous improvement. <br /><br />
            Architectured a sophisticated multi-tiered system, ensuring fluid
            information flow and real-time feedback on player decisions,
            enhancing the learning curve.

          <h2>Ciphers</h2>
          <p>
            The “Ciphers” project is an educational initiative aimed at
            exploring various encryption techniques and their applications in
            cybersecurity. This project involves understanding, implementing,
            and analyzing different cipher algorithms, highlighting their
            strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. <br /><br />
            Utilized the implementation of Caeser Cipher and Vigenere Cipher and
            allowed for user to decrypt and encrypt words and sentences of their
            choice.
          </p>

          <h2>Food Web Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Developed a comprehensive C program to model ecological food webs,
            focusing on dynamic memory management. Implemented features to build
            and modify the web structure, including predator-prey relationships,
            using dynamic arrays and pointers. <br /><br />
            The program supports analysis of ecological roles (such as apex
            predators and producers), dietary flexibility, and impacts of
            species extinction on the web. Integrated command-line arguments for
            customizable program execution modes and ensured efficient memory
            usage with meticulous allocation and deallocation practices.
